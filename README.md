# [The Regex Guide](http://bit.ly/2M8LI0w)

Start writing regular expressions even if you don’t have any knowledge about them!\
Built from [Gatsby’s default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

## Introduction

Most of the current regex tools allow you to run a regular expression to test a text. This process requires to have knowledge on regular expressions. If you don’t have this knowledge, testing your regular expression becomes painful! 🥺

The Regex Guide does the opposite by helping you to build your regex, step-by-step. While you add pieces to a plain english sentence, The Regex Guide writes the corresponding regular expression. Hit the _copy to clipboard_ button and you’re good to go! 🚀

## Contributing

Regular expressions are a wide subject. At this time, The Regex Guide covers a tiny part of it. To make The Regex Guide a more complete guide, contributions are very welcomed! 🤗

To do so, if you have any subjects to cover as quantifiers or else to add or fix, please open an issue. This allow people to weigh in on the discussion before you start working and submit any pull request.

The Regex Guide is powered by Gatsby. Run `gatsby develop` to start the project on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## What’s the footer logo?

You’ll notice a logo on the footer of the website. Building The Regex Guide requires research, dedication, and more. All these on my free time. I hope you won’t mind this footer link that allows me to promote this other project I’m working on 🙏
