# [The Regex Guide](http://bit.ly/2M8LI0w)

![alt text](/readme-image.gif).

Start writing regular expressions even if you don’t have any knowledge about them!\
Built from [Gatsby’s default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

## Introduction

Most of the current regex tools allow you to run a regular expression to test a text. This process requires to have knowledge on regular expressions. If you don’t have this knowledge, testing your regular expression becomes painful! 🥺

The Regex Guide does the opposite by helping you to build your regex, step-by-step. While you add pieces to a plain english sentence, The Regex Guide writes the corresponding regular expression. Hit the _copy to clipboard_ button and you’re good to go! 🚀

## Supporting

I work on the Regex Guide on my free time. For this, I won't ask you to back the project. Instead, I rather prefer to add a footer logo on the website to promote an other project of mine. Hope you won't mind! 🙏
